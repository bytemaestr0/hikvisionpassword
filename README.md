# hikvisionpassword
A simple python program that retrieves the password of your hikvision camera that you forgot.
It tries one or more passwords you have stored in a file, which are separated by a new line. This test passwords on a single hivision camera at a time. Works on any hikvision camera no matter the model. 
It asks for the ip, password file, and concurrent workers(more=quicker requests).

DISCLAIMER: Only use this on a camera that you OWN or have EXPLICIT PERMISSION to test on. Not meant to be used ilegally, use at your own risk.
